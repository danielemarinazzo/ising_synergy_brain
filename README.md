Ising model implemented on the individual structural connectome


This repository contains the code that we used to implement the Ising model on individual structural connectomes, namely the NKI-Rockland connectomes retrieved from the UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Database (http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org/).

We also report the results (value of the synergy for each of the 188 regions, for each of the 196 subjects, and a vector with the age of each subject).

The methods and results are reported in this paper
